This is a repository of several projects I've worked on for assignments.

--------------------

PYTHON PROJECTS:

The calculator.py is a simple calculator that will do basic arithmatic.

The TechStocks project pulls data from a database, performs various calculations, and displays that information for the user in a GUI.

The MovieArchives - GUI project pulls data from a database for display and allows users to add more movies to the database. The data is stored and can be viewed later.
 
 --------------------
 
PYTHON/HTML PROJECT:

The SimpleMovieDatabase project creates a simple website (localhost:8080 while the program is running) that allows 3 users to log in and add movie data to the database. It is stored and can be viewed by the user that entered that data at a later date. Log in information in the README.txt file.

The PayrollEntryWebsite projects creates a simple website (locahost:8080 while the program is running) that allows an employee to enter their employee ID (found in the payroll.db) and the number of hours they have worked. They can also click to view the list of employees within a given department and their total pay for that pay period.

HTML PROJECT:

The MusicWebsite project is a website coded for a fake music lesson studio. The site was created with a mobile-first approach so it will scale with your device.
