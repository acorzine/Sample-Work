This is a repository of several projects I've worked on for assignments.

The calculator.py is a simple calculator that will do basic arithmatic.

The TechStocks project pulls data from a database, performs various calculations, and displays that information for the user in a GUI.

The MovieArchives - GUI project pulls data from a database for display and allows users to add more movies to the database. The data is stored and can be viewed later.

The SimpleMovieDatabase project creates a simple website (localhost:8080 while the program is running) that allows 3 users to log in and add movie data to the database. It is stored and can be viewed by the user that entered that data at a later date. Log in information in the README.txt file.
